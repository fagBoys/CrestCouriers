                                <p>As the year commenced the spread of the COVID-19 virus is one that is yet to be contained, continuing to affect millions of jobs and sectors every day. The transportation and logistics industry are ones that continue to provide one of the most vital services in our current modernised global and interconnected world, meaning with the current restrictions put into place many companies are facing national and international trade and transportation issues within this climate. In this instance, there has therefore been a variety of interpretations surrounding future impact and risk implications which we will further explore within this article.</p>


                                <p>While we are moving into a digital era, our current society is leading towards a constant and further demand for purchases online. Therefore, the need for reliable delivery couriers are more important than ever. This is why the importance around following the new introduced health and safety precautions surrounding the outbreak, whilst continuing keeping drivers and staff members safe will remain a vital priority. Due to this increased demand there is also the opportunity for a new market. As hospitals and private medical sectors are more strained that ever, it has been key to be able to deliver medical supplies where necessary and expand into logistical partners for medicine and similar industries for the future.</p>

                                <p>The UK formally exited the EU on 31st January 2020. The 11-month transition period meant for negotiating a new trade deal will come to an end on 31st December. But there is still no sign of a new deal. In the absence of a free trade deal, which would allow goods to be transported without any tariffs, UK will default to WTO tariffs.</p>


                                <p>
                                    Along with a good chance that taxes will be applicable to imports and exports between the UK and EU, it is also a given that customs regulations will be enacted at the border. Customs regulations will most likely result in delays at the border, causing disruption in supply chains and directly affecting fast-moving consumer goods (like vegetables, fruits, cadies, toiletries, etc.) Moreover, new IT systems need to be installed and customs staff recruited to run operations at the border.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    More than half of the UK’s import and export takes place with the EU. This means that the government and the businesses inside UK who deal with parties in the EU are presented with the great challenge of ensuring efficiency in the transport of goods between the UK and the EU. Both are largely underprepared in this regard.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While businesses have their own challenges to deal with in terms of complying with customs requirements and smooth sailing of relevant paperwork, they have also expressed serious concern to the government over the lack of clarity in how things will be run in the logistics industry. The government, on the other hand, has invested millions to try to ensure smooth sailing of the new systems. Detailed instruction manuals are being published on the government’s official website to assist businesses to comply with new regulations.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">

                                    But the fact remains that it is not possible to efficiently transition from a 40-year-old system of trade to a new one in just one year. There are gaps and holes in how preparations are being made for post-transition period trade. Industry specialists are expecting many disruptions and delays in border checks and supply lines, all of which will affect the timely delivery of goods to consumers. Moreover, customers will most likely have to put up with increased product prices, thanks to tariffs. From what it looks like, a brief period of chaos will ensue following the end of the transition period on 31st December.

                                <p>Lorry drivers are responsible for providing essential supplies to citizens across the country. In fact, they were identified as key workers by the government during the pandemic. Travelling on roads for days, they need to park their vehicles at some safe and convenient spot at night, so they can get some rest and sleep. However, there is currently a shortage of such safe parking areas for lorry drivers. According to the Road Haulage Association, there is a need for about 11,000 safe, overnight parking places for HGVs.</p>


                                <p>
                                    While the quality and availability of parking areas for lorries has been a concern for drivers for some time, the growing incidents of lorries being targeted by thieves has led to increased alarm over the safety of the drivers and the goods they are transporting. The National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service reported that goods amounting to nearly £50 million had been stolen in over 3,000 lorry thefts in the UK from January to September.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Most robberies occur at unsafe parking locations at night time when drivers stop to sleep. Resistance is difficult, considering the thieves could be armed and could potentially harm the drivers. In such a scenario, drivers are usually relying only on luck to protect them from being the next one to fall prey to a robbery. The robberies sometimes result in damage to lorries, necessitating that they are taken off the roads for repair. They can also cause a delay in delivery of goods to consumers and may result in goods being damaged, which then results in further problems for the customer.
                                </p>

                                    Back in November, a lorry was hijacked on a road in Northamptonshire, with the driver and a security guard tied up as the thieves made off with £5 million worth of Apple products. The pair and the lorry were later abandoned on the road, while the thieves changed two vehicles and made off with the stolen items successfully. The stolen products included Apple iPhones, Watches, and chargers. The police in Northamptonshire had asked people to come up if they had seen vehicles that may have looked out of place or if they had been offered Apple products at unusually low prices.

                                    With multiple thieves responsible for around 30,000 lorry thefts in the UK at large, lorry drivers continue to feel unsafe, businesses face potential losses, and customers have to put up with delayed deliveries of goods.
